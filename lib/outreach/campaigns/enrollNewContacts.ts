/**
 * Computes which of a campaign's currently-pending enrollments should be
 * scheduled and onto which pool mailbox, WITHOUT writing anything - the
 * caller applies the plan inside its own `runAtomic` block, alongside
 * whatever else it needs to do atomically (the initial campaign-start
 * route also flips `campaigns.status` to "active" in that same
 * transaction; a later contacts-import into an already-active campaign
 * does not need to touch campaign status at all). Splitting "compute the
 * plan" from "commit the plan" this way means both callers keep the exact
 * atomicity they need instead of sharing one write path that would have to
 * compromise between them.
