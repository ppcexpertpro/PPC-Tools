 * whole sequencer exists to produce, and the one an operator scans a list of
 * 500 rows looking for - so it is the only status drawn filled, and it wins
 * against everything else on the page including the primary button. Treating
 * it as just another green pill next to `active` and `healthy` is what made
 * the old all-grey tables unreadable in the first place.
